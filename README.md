# Introduction
The project aims to analyze the Global Superstore dataset with Power BI, focusing on key metrics like total sales, product-specific sales, regional sales, and year-over-year comparisons. Through data visualization, it seeks insights into sales performance, product trends, and geographic patterns to inform decision-making and optimize business strategies

# ***Data Cleaning & Modeling in Power BI: Global Superstore***

In the initial phase of the project, the Global Superstore dataset is imported into Power BI. Through meticulous data cleaning and modeling processes, a relational structure is established among three primary tables: Orders (fact table), People, and Returns (dimension tables). This structured model serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis and visualization tasks.

# ***Data***
The data source is the Global Superstore dataset.

# Project Overview
***Comprehensive Analysis with Detailed Visualizations***

This project adopts a holistic approach, commencing with rigorous data cleaning for enhanced reliability. Visual representations are intelligently segmented by country, region, and market, offering targeted insights into the dataset. Additionally, each visualization includes a table view for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying data. In-depth shipping analysis delves into preferences across different ship modes, while sales data is meticulously examined across cities, states, regions, and markets, revealing intricate trends and patterns. Supporting tables further augment the insights by providing granular details. Furthermore, the project features detailed visualizations focusing on shipping and product metrics, enriching the analytical depth of the exploration.
